                <p class="lead section-lead">Ritika, you have been an exceptional Data Scientist in Residence for General Assembly's fourth <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive?utm_medium=social&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=josephdsi">Data Science Immersive</a> in Washington, DC. It has truly been an honor to work with you. So much so, in fact, that we made you a poorly designed Thank You note that will live for forever or at least until Github goes down again. (How poorly designed? The template included the above stock image that refreshes every page load. We found it so funny that we opted to not change it. Seriously, <a href="">refresh</a>. It's hilarious what you'll find.) </p>
                <p class="lead section-lead"> From students to coworkers, we are deeply appreciative of the work you've put in to assure the success of the next crop of data scientists. </p>
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <h1 class="section-heading">Students</h1>
                    <p class="lead section-lead">You've made a huge impact the future careers of many.</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika is much cooler than I am but she is still happy to talk to me about my problems. She has terrific taste in t-shirts. I genuinely feel super lucky to have had her.</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">She is pretty awesome, and answers all my stupid questions</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Awesome job Ritika! I hope you put professional cat herder on your LinkedIn Profile. You can herd with the best of them! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk7yqlTMvp8</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika has the perfect combination of skills to compliment the DSI 4 team. Her compassion and logical thinking combine for a great mix of competent skills. She has learned very quickly on the job about how to tailor her skills for a wide range of students. </p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Also, she is funny, energetic and curious. She's the perfect (human) data scientist.</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika has always either had time for any question or concern, or made time for it. She checks in with everyone regularly, and has been a fantastic member of our trio of instructors. Thank you so much Ritika!</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika has been an incredible resource throughout the cohort. She's a great instructor who is able to put up with a lot of crap from all of us when we're tried and frustrated. Her interest in the subject shows through her work, and it sounds schlocky but she's honestly been an inspiration to me.</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika is pretty exceptional and is quite possibly one of the most patient, intelligent and hardworking people that I've gotten to work with...her puns are pretty good too</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">She has a natural tendency for teaching and is very approachable. I really like how laid back she is, and she's very smart. It is very noticeable that she enjoys data science.</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">She was so helpful and many times more approachable than the instructors. She has a great sense of humor which made her very engaging.</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Thanks Ritika for all your hard work. It's a little hard to believe that you were in DSI3 yourself when you come off like you've been doing data science for years. Keep doing what you're doing, you're gonna do great things I'm sure of it. You also have good intuition when it comes to knowing how the class is feeling about certain things and in advance offering to have quiz study sessions usually before people would even ask, you just knew.</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika is a light in a sea of darkness. She is incredibly knowledgeable, brilliant, tenacious, fun, and supportive. As DSIR, she has always been the first, last, and best resource for any issue or problem. Whenever something went wrong, you could count on her to not only help solve it, but also teach you a deeper understanding so you would become a better coder/data scientist in the process. Her patience with the massive amount of questions from 24 students is undoubtedly unrivaled. Simply put, she was the best DSIR anyone could ask for.</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika was an AWESOME DSIR! She wasn't only knowledgable and proficient in the material, she is extremely patient and encouraging. She always went out of her way to help us, make sure we understand the material, provide us with extra resources and support (including writing reviews and cheat sheets from scratch). She stayed way after her official office hours (or even when it wasn't her office hours at all) to help with stuff, or even just to chat or give a pep talk. She's also super cool with the dope sunglasses and neat t-shirts! She was definitely an asset for the students of DSI4 and any workplace would be lucky to have her. I wish her lots and lots of luck in her new job!</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika rulez</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">It's been a pleasure having you in the classroom over the past 12 weeks. Your personality, wit and knowledge have been a great asset to the class along with your solution code and help on projects. You will be a valuable asset anywhere your career takes you. </p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">What was great about Ritika: she really seemed to care about all of us, and she would go out of her way to help us. If we asked her a question, it never seemed like it was a chore for her, she was always happy to help. And when we thanked her, she would thank us back. She was truly selfless, in my opinion. And so funny! And it was amazing how well she understood everything and could explain it. I mean all of this (no exaggeration). Ritika's the best. I legitimately hope she will be my friend after the cohort. -Elias</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika is the bomb.com for everything she's done for us. Her lab feedback is much appreciated.</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">When I want to feel encouraged about data science, I hear Ritika's inflected voice in my ear, telling me that *literally* all I need to do is the best I can. She's the voice that tells me not to give up on something, while at the same time taking the stress off of my need to make it perfect. She's the best because I want to impress her, learn from her, and hang out with her all at the same time.</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika has a way of talking us all off a ledge through her relatability and jokes. When she doesn't know the answer to your questions immediately, you can rely on her to follow up within a few hours. She knows how to prioritize problems and handle them efficiently (even if you want your question answered immediately). She better remain in my life forever!</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">The next DSIR has his work cut out for him, trying to live up to the standard that Ritika has now set. She is incredibly dedicated, continually going the extra mile (or fifty), explains concepts in a thorough yet digestible manner, and adapts her problem-solving style to meet the situation at hand. Also, she's just dope as a person.</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika, it has been a pleasure to go from being your instructor to your coworker. Your empathy, humor, and determination to see our students succeed brought a leading level of patience and support. Both GA and the students cannot thank you enough for your efforts to go above and beyond. I’ve been lucky to both teach and learn from you. I know you’ll do impactful, top-notch work at DevResults and beyond. </p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph"> Ritika, Thank you so much for all of the hard work, late nights, and long days over this past cohort. I'm so glad that you trusted us enough to take the leap of faith to join us for DSI3, and loved us enough to want to stay for DSI4. Serving as the perfect addition to Matt and Joseph, your care for our students was palpable and I am incredibly grateful to have had you on the team. I'm so proud of the work that you've done, and I hope you're infinitely prouder of yourself. I wish you the best of luck in your next role, but I know you won't need it. You're a rockstar and I know you're going to crush it. -- Shanaz

                    PS: I hear you like comedy. Let's go to The Big Hunt together! :)</p>

                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph"> We have been incredibly lucky to have had you serve alongside us on the instructional team. As DSIR, you have been able to find Joseph's and my blind spots. You went above and beyond what we asked of you and, more importantly, you were willing to challenge us when necessary. Your sense of empathy coupled with your tough love approach has been beneficial for both the students and GA as a whole in ways I cannot put into words. I will truly, sincerely miss having you work with me every day. (Are you _SURE_ you want to leave us?) It's fine, it's fine, I just anticipate making lots of plans to have drinks in the future, then have you bail for asthmatic or cat-related reasons. It's fine. It's fine.</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika: I will truly miss having you on campus. You were an awesome student and an even better instructor. You are inquisitive AF-PLEASE do not be a stranger! - Sami</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika, your dry wit and humor will be sorely missed around the instructor lounge. You made us all a little smarter and much more woke. Good luck on your next adventure, but come back and visit! Free lunch Thursdays! - Nayana</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika, I could not be more impressed with everything you’ve accomplished as a DSIR. Your dedication and empathy towards your students is profound and impresses me daily.  I am truly going to miss having you on campus every day, you are an absolute force and I am jealous of your new coworkers that get to work with you everyday. (Not only because now I’m the only one keeping Matt and Joseph in line). I wish you blissful relaxation before you start your new job, with your cat, new apartment, and maybe some cheeky Nandos :) All the best, Lauren</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika! Your wit, eclectic knowledge, sense of humor, wide-ranging tastes in art, music literature, and your political musings will be sorely missed! I enjoyed our conversations very much. Let’s hang out sometime in the near future! -James</p>
