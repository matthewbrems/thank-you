It has truly been an honor to work with you. So much so, in fact, that we made you a poorly designed Thank You note that will live for forever or at least until Github goes down again. (How poorly designed? The template included the above stock image that refreshes every page load. We found it so funny that we opted to not change it. Seriously, <a href="">refresh</a>. It's hilarious what you'll find.) </p>

You teach data science in a way that is understandable for us and you are very active to ensure your students understand the material.

Even after 12 hours of instruction, when we were all tired, he was the one in front of the white board pushing us to learn more. It is because of him I learned so much and successfully completed an excruciating course, best wishes Speck!" - Kenneth Yale</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">"Matt, I thank you for improving my life, and the lives of so many. You are patient, kind, and always went the extra mile to ensure I understood the material. You encouraged me to believe in myself. You encouraged me keep going when I didn't think I could. You stretched my mind and gave me treasures untold. Rare is the person who is smart, kind, and humble. Whatever your future endeavors, I hope that you'll succeed in every way. Thank you. Thank you. A thousand times, I thank you. " - Sian Lewis </p>

I appreciate all the aid you've given me throughout all the weeks of DSI and all the patience you have exhibited dealing with all the aid I have asked for. I am really excited for whatever new venture you will be entering next and all the data science-y things that you'll output. I wish you all the best in things to come (the best necessarily including &pizza). Keep in touch! Or don't, that's up to you! You're a free man!" - Hector Ian Martinez </p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">"Matt, Thank you for being an amazing instructor. You were not just able to guide me, a complete novice at coding, by going step by step and actually making me grow in confidence as my knowledge grew, but you were able to do with compassion and laughter.  I will always be grateful for that. Wherever you go next I wish you nothing but the best and know that wherever you end up will be lucky to have you." - Anonymous </p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika, it has been a pleasure to go from being your instructor to your coworker. Your empathy, humor, and determination to see our students succeed brought a leading level of patience and support. Both GA and the students cannot thank you enough for your efforts to go above and beyond. Iâ€™ve been lucky to both teach and learn from you. I know youâ€™ll do impactful, top-notch work at DevResults and beyond. </p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph"> Ritika, Thank you so much for all of the hard work, late nights, and long days over this past cohort. I'm so glad that you trusted us enough to take the leap of faith to join us for DSI3, and loved us enough to want to stay for DSI4. Serving as the perfect addition to Matt and Joseph, your care for our students was palpable and I am incredibly grateful to have had you on the team. I'm so proud of the work that you've done, and I hope you're infinitely prouder of yourself. I wish you the best of luck in your next role, but I know you won't need it. You're a rockstar and I know you're going to crush it. -- Shanaz

                    <p class="section-paragraph"> We have been incredibly lucky to have had you serve alongside us on the instructional team. As DSIR, you have been able to find Joseph's and my blind spots. You went above and beyond what we asked of you and, more importantly, you were willing to challenge us when necessary. Your sense of empathy coupled with your tough love approach has been beneficial for both the students and GA as a whole in ways I cannot put into words. I will truly, sincerely miss having you work with me every day. (Are you _SURE_ you want to leave us?) It's fine, it's fine, I just anticipate making lots of plans to have drinks in the future, then have you bail for asthmatic or cat-related reasons. It's fine. It's fine.</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika: I will truly miss having you on campus. You were an awesome student and an even better instructor. You are inquisitive AF-PLEASE do not be a stranger! - Sami</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika, your dry wit and humor will be sorely missed around the instructor lounge. You made us all a little smarter and much more woke. Good luck on your next adventure, but come back and visit! Free lunch Thursdays! - Nayana</p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika, I could not be more impressed with everything youâ€™ve accomplished as a DSIR. Your dedication and empathy towards your students is profound and impresses me daily.  I am truly going to miss having you on campus every day, you are an absolute force and I am jealous of your new coworkers that get to work with you everyday. (Not only because now Iâ€™m the only one keeping Matt and Joseph in line). I wish you blissful relaxation before you start your new job, with your cat, new apartment, and maybe some cheeky Nandos :) All the best, Lauren</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">Ritika! Your wit, eclectic knowledge, sense of humor, wide-ranging tastes in art, music literature, and your political musings will be sorely missed! I enjoyed our conversations very much. Letâ€™s hang out sometime in the near future! -James</p>
