It has truly been an honor to work with you. So much so, in fact, that we made you a poorly designed Thank You note that will live for forever or at least until Github goes down again. (How poorly designed? The template included the above stock image that refreshes every page load. We found it so funny that we opted to not change it. Seriously, <a href="">refresh</a>. It's hilarious what you'll find.) </p>
                <p class="lead section-lead"> From students to coworkers, we are deeply appreciative of the work you've put in to assure the success of the next crop of data scientists. </p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">"Thanks Matt for that you did for our DSI DC cohort. You teach data science in a way that is understandable for us and you are very active to ensure your students understand the material. I am sure I can speak for everyone at past cohorts you have taught that we appreciated your teaching and we wish the best of luck to you in your future endeavors. LET'S GO CAPS!" - Joshua Sung</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">"I've never had a more dedicated teacher/instructor. Even after 12 hours of instruction, when we were all tired, he was the one in front of the white board pushing us to learn more. It is because of him I learned so much and successfully completed an excruciating course, best wishes Speck!" - Kenneth Yale</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">"Speck, you were an great teacher during DSI-5 (and I assume the other cohorts as well)! I wish you the best of luck in whatever you are up to next. You're a natural teacher and I hope you continue to teach in some capacity or other." - Aakash Tandel</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">"Matt, I thank you for improving my life, and the lives of so many. You are patient, kind, and always went the extra mile to ensure I understood the material. You encouraged me to believe in myself. You encouraged me keep going when I didn't think I could. You stretched my mind and gave me treasures untold. Rare is the person who is smart, kind, and humble. Whatever your future endeavors, I hope that you'll succeed in every way. Thank you. Thank you. A thousand times, I thank you. " - Sian Lewis </p>

Great taste in TV shows, tweets, meal replacement products and states. #squadzilla4lyfe. GA is losing a great one." - Diego Rodriguez</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">"Matthew Joaquim Speck. I appreciate all the aid you've given me throughout all the weeks of DSI and all the patience you have exhibited dealing with all the aid I have asked for. I am really excited for whatever new venture you will be entering next and all the data science-y things that you'll output. I wish you all the best in things to come (the best necessarily including &pizza). Keep in touch! Or don't, that's up to you! You're a free man!" - Hector Ian Martinez </p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">"Speck, I told you before, you are a a very talented mentor. You totally own it and not affraid to say "i don't know". But you always make an effort and return with an answer." - Anonymous </p>
                    <hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
                    <p class="section-paragraph">"Matt, Thank you for being an amazing instructor. You were not just able to guide me, a complete novice at coding, by going step by step and actually making me grow in confidence as my knowledge grew, but you were able to do with compassion and laughter.  I will always be grateful for that. Wherever you go next I wish you nothing but the best and know that wherever you end up will be lucky to have you." - Anonymous </p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">"Speck, in the short while I’ve known you, you’ve been a diligent student, ambitious colleague, and respectful friend. In class, you consistently pressed to know the deeper “Why,” providing polite methodological challenges throughout the 12-week cohort. On an early project, you produced a result of which you were not proud – I recall sitting with you one-on-one as you described how you would have completed the project differently, and how you would progress on future work. You subsequently produced class-leading results, and it became little surprise you joined General Assembly as an instructor for future classes. Your grit, growth, and continued curiosity to excel is a model for anyone at any stage in their career. GA has benefited substantially from your dedication, and I look forward to seeing what you do next.
