Upon finishing up as a Data Scientist in Residence at General Assembly's [Data Science Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive?utm_medium=social&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=josephdsi) program, we wanted to create a static site that commemorates all the things we appreciate about Ritika's stellar performance. 

Thank you, Ritika.
