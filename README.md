## We will sincerely miss you, Matt.

This repository hosts this [site](http://speck.gq).

Matt Speck has been a member of General Assembly's [Data Science Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive) team in Washington, D.C. for over a year. During his time, he has helped to mentor and train fifty successful, collaborative, and ethical data scientists.

Upon finishing up as a Local Lead Instructor, we wanted to create a static site that expresses our gratitude in a small way. Thank you for all you have done, Matt!
